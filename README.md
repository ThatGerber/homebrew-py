homebrew-py
-----------

This is a [Homebrew][] tap containing some (Python-related) formulae that can't
be easily built with [pip][]. At the moment, it just consists of the
[Python gstreamer bindings][pygst] package.

[pip]: http://www.pip-installer.org/
[pygst]: http://pygstdocs.berlios.de/
[Homebrew]: https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/

To use this formula repository, just [tap][] it:

    $ brew tap sampsyo/py
    $ brew install gst-python
